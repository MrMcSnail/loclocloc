# Location, Location, Location

This function will be called with an array of objects, each object representing a student on the Northcoders bootcamp. Some of the students have a specified `location` property which is a string of the office they will be attending during their time on the course, but for some students that property is missing.

Your function should return a **new array**, where all objects that were missing a `location` have been updated so that they now have a `location` property with a value of `"remote"`. All other properties should remain as they were.

This function must be a **pure function**, i.e. it should have no side effects, and your test suite should reflect this.

```js
updateRemoteStudents([
  { name: 'Hypatia', age: 31, location: 'leeds' },
  { name: 'Ramanujan', age: 22 },
  { name: 'Tao', age: 47, location: 'manchester' }
]);

// should return

[
  { name: 'Hypatia', age: 31, location: 'leeds' },
  { name: 'Ramanujan', age: 22, location: 'remote' },
  { name: 'Tao', age: 47, location: 'manchester' }
];
```
